                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Strong as frick and basically as fast a Sonic (can easily match Sonic's jogging pace without breaking a sweat), Benji is the coolest and most ripped hedgehog of them all. He's a big brother to three siblings: Hunter (7), Tanner (6), Clarissa (4). All of them look up to him and he is a great role model not just to his siblings, but to everyone around him. Even Shadow respects Benji as a peer. He has to or else he'd feel the wrath of his epic combat skills. Benji the Hdgehog is a ruthless warrior with a heart of gold.</p>
